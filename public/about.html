                    <p class="description">
                      I was accepted as a clarinet performance student at Vanderbilt University's Blair School of Music. Coming from high school, I had every intention of pursuing my dream of being an orchestra clarinetist one day. Vanderbilt was the perfect choice, because above all, I wanted to be surrounded by individuals with backgrounds different than my own. Vanderbilt is an institution of knowledge-seeking and myopia-crushing, and thus I found myself involved in many different things.

                    <p class="description">
                      I found music education long before college. I taught private clarinet lessons, participated in <i>Harmony Project Phoenix</i>, a local nonprofit dedicated to the education of musicians from underserved schools, and completed my Eagle Scout Project, which was a musical instrument drive that sourced instruments for schools in South Phoenix. I love playing in ensembles large and small, and want to make sure that others get that same opportunity.

                    <p class="description">
                      I have always been interested in electronics. From an early age, I was designing circuits on breadboards in my closet, making sure to leave several burn marks from experiments gone wrong. That joy of making followed me all the way to Vanderbilt, where I continued such activities at the Wond'ry, Vanderbilt's Innovation Hub. Through great resources and connections, I have worked on several projects, including a 4-channel, 1000W amplifier, and a custom-designed electronics workshop. My love of electronics even brought me to Vanderbilt Plant Operations, where I completed and internship within the controls department. Engineering, while not my major or minor, has provided me with a unique opportunity to express teaching, philanthropy, creativity, and diligence.

                    <p class="description">
                      It's hard to come to the realization that the thing you've been studying for the past couple years might not be right for you. Each new day, I felt more and more distant from the ejoyment I used to derive from teaching and performing. By meeting new people, taking interesting classes, and making friends from all backgrounds, I realized that I was not satisfied by my current field of study. I knew that if I went on to become a teacher, I wouldn't be the kind of role model that my students deserve. In the Fall of 2018, I re-organized my free credit hours and set out to complete Vanderbilt's Undergraduate Business Minor. It was a breath of fresh air. Particularly exciting for me was marketing, and I spent plenty of time looking for new ways to learn and get involved. The business minor is ultimately the reason why I chose to apply to Owen's Master of Marketing program.

                    <p class="description">
                      My biggest concern while switching my focus from music to marketing was a lack of specialization. I spent years refining my musical abilities, and not nearly as long working on my business literacy. However, the most valuable lesson that Vanderbilt has taught me is that everything is transferable. Working on a difficult passage in clarinet literature maps perfectly to preparing for a presentation in an entrepreneurship class. Learning how to fit 3-4 hours of practice into each and every day helps refine time management skills. I don't waste time wishing I had chosen a different major because I know that all knowledge is valuable.

                      When it comes to work/life balance, I know that I'll have some planning to do. My dream is to be able to work and keep my hobbies around. If that means carpentry on the weekends, coding in the early morning, and community orchestra at night, then so be it. I'm happy to pursue many different things because I believe in the power of knowledge transfer.

        Understanding that all knowledge is valuable and transferable is Vanderbilt's greatest gift to me. I'm proud to be a clarinetist, an engineer, a marketer, and all of the rest. Most importantly, I'm thankful for all of the people I've gotten the opportunity to meet. They've left me with invaluable stories, experiences, and perspectives. I can't wait to see where my career brings me!
